# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Project Name:

WILLYCOLLECTIONS

Description:

This is a full-featured React e-commerce application that allows users to browse, search, add items to carts, checkout, and manage orders. Key features include:

User authentication and authorization
Product listings and details
Shopping cart functionality
Secure checkout process
Order confirmation

Technologies Used:

React
React Router DOM
Context API (Optional: Redux can be used as an alternative)
Firebase

Setup Instructions:

Clone the repository:

Bash
git clone https://github.com/GabrielOchieng/willycollections.git

Install dependencies:

Bash
cd your-repo-name
npm install

Configure Firebase

Create a Firebase project or account for your backend service.
Follow the service's specific instructions to obtain configuration details like API keys and database URLs.
Update the configuration settings in your code (typically in a separate file like firebaseConfig.js) with your obtained values.
Start the development server:

Bash
npm start

This will typically run the application on http://localhost:3000 (or a similar port).
